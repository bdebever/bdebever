ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bdebever

Previous co-founder of tocco, the world's first AI-powered material discovery platform. After a recent pause to focus on personal priorities, I'm eager to embark on new challenges and contribute to innovative projects.

I am interested in the health and longevity space, convinced that AI is completely disrupting the game ðŸ§¬ 

A builder at heart, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges. My diverse skill set and entrepreneurial spirit have led me to explore various industries, including crypto, where I've been active as an investor and advisor since 2017.

Previously a growth engineer at Gorgias and founder of Feedier, a software company I started in college.
